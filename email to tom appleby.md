Hi Tom,
Hope all is well down in the big smoke.
I was hoping to ask a small favour of you. As part of my course I need to look at my personal branding and professional presentation. I'm trying to benchmark how effective my current profile is. Since you were my point of contact for recruitment, if you have time it would be great to get your thoughts on how I presented myself when I first applied for the internship.

It'd be nice to get an idea of whether there was a particular factor that stood out (e.g. designy CV, portfolio, demonstrable experience, etc), how much of it was down to the test project and whether there was anything that you think could stand to be improved. 

I'd ask Mr Fairweather too but as far as I know he's on a boat eating seagulls or something now. 

Let me know if you have any questions. It would be great to get some more professional perspective.

Thanks
Kyle
