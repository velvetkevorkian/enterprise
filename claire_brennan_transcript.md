#Clare Brennan Interview: 11/12/2013
Featuring:
    Clare Brennan (CB)
    Kyle Macquarrie (KM)
    
CB: My role within NEoN is as project manager, and also to curate a number of the events. In terms of marketing within industry, that's not really what we're about; we're not looking for clients for any profit, so I couldn't speak to that. You spoke about a number of the bigger projects you were interested in. 

KM: Yeah, I spoke to Mal from Quartic Llama, because they have that dual identity where they're doing their games stuff...

CB: Did you find that helpful?

KM: Yeah, he had some really good insights about manipulating the narrative that you're telling, depending on the circumstances. When you have something like *100,000 Lux*, that's something that's very specific to that place and that time, how you go about finding someone to do that? 

CB: We're often inspired by spaces. We start out looking for spaces that you wouldn't necessarily relate to in an arts context, non-arts spaces essentially. That's what we're excited by. We did *100,000 Lux* there, we've taken over the Greenamrket car park, we took over the Law hill for a night. This year we took over the Olympia swimming pool, the Vision building, things like that. We usually go into a space. What also helps guide us is[...]that we always theme the festival, so that helps us focus our thinking a wee bit. Every year we get really excited and program far too much, then we have to scale it back. It's goood to have some sort of theme. Usually they're pretty loose, we had character design as a theme one year, the year just past, 2013, it was the spaces in-between... they're usually open to interpretation, but it brings us back to how we're going to think about this, and also it helps us define who we might want to work with, who might be able to realise a project within the space that we've considered. Specifically with *100,000 Lux* we knew that technology was available, but it had never been used before. A lot of what Abertay does is interdisciplinary working, they promote and try to encourage that a lot. I deal with that a lot with the exhibitions here at the Hannah McClure centre as well, trying to use the medium of the arts to convey sometimes really complex research, scientific research specifically. So that's kind of what we did for *100,000 Lux*, we saw it as a vehicle for telling a more complex narrative, and I knew just from keeping my ear to the ground, really, about some of the research that was going on in the university at the time. What I found really interesting was some of the research into solar activity, so I started to look into who was working in that field, and pulled together a team just for initial discussions, basically keeping it really open and not signing anyone up for a particular role at the beginning, just having a chat about what's your research, what's the technology, how might that make sense together, and it kind of just evolved from there. 

KM: That's just like a personal network?

CB: It is, yeah. I think that is really, really crucial. That's one of the things I'm trying to get across to my fourth years just now, that are studying computer arts and stuff: being part of your local creative community is number one. It's true. Networking's a horrible word... I kind of enjoy it, it doesn't feel like a task, but just to be really open. I think that's one thing that Dundee's really good at as well, the creative community in Dundee is really open about what are you up to just now? As soon as you say I was thinking about doing something like this, they'll say oh, have you spoken to so-and-so? It's just that sort of human level of it. Being good at socialising, conversing, conveying quite articulately what it is that you're looking to do.  

KM: Yeah, I spoke to some people from the Fleet Collective and they were saying much the same thing, having that community.

CB: That's what they're good at, that's what Creative Dundee are really good at, doing the midweek meets and the Pecha Kuchas and all that, it's just a really good way of networking essentially. Not just within the creative community either. A lot of the work that I've done here, we've worked with counselors and therapists, or forensic scientists, or physicists, with the police, people that might be a little bit like my work's got nothing to do with your work, why would you be interested in what I'm doing? Why would I be interested in what you're doing? I think there's different modes of language that need to be used when conversing with different communities. 

KM: When you're talking to people about commissioning work or curating stuff, do say this person is an artist and you talk to them one way, this person is a technologist and you talk to them another way?

CB: It's not as conscious as that. I think you need to be a bit of a social chameleon, and you need to be able to reflect the language that's coming at you, to be able to respond to that really quickly. Just essentially to be a good communicator. I don't necessarily put people in boxes. You maybe go with expectations, but you'll soon find they get blown out of the water anyway. It's not as simple as that. 

KM: Do you find most of the people you're working with are somewhere in between, at that intersection? 

CB: Yeah. You soon find a common ground. I think if you're a good communicator you can try and hook it in, and make it relevant to them. That's really important. What are they going to get out of it? It can't just be, I want something from you. Because I take the role of curator it's probably a bit different from a client commissioning, in a commercial sense. There's more of a closely aligned journey that you all go on together.

KM: You just kind of let it happen.

CB: Yeah. Maybe the artist doesn't like that, I don't know. Different curators work in different ways, but I find the best way to achieve what you both want from it is just to keep the lines of communication open all the time, and sometimes it can be really challenging, and a lot of work, especially when you're trying to communicate something visual via emails, or over the phone. The exhibition that's on just now, because the artist is based in London, a lot of that was done by Skyping â€” it's just so, so difficult to visualise what each other's speaking about. You end up doing these mad wee doodles, is this what you mean? But it's not like, go away and make me something and come back in two months and show me it. 

KM: You see a lot of people working in that crative technology field, and there is a weird tension between this really amazing creative stuff and, like, it ends up in an ad campaign, and how do you exploit that to your advantage, if you can't avoid it.
