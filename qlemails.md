Subject: Can I interview one (or more) of you, please? 

Hello,
I'm a fourth year Digital Interaction Design student at DJCAD in Dundee. As
part of my dissertation research I'm looking at how people and companies who
work across different fields present and market themselves effectively.

I was wondering if you would be open to answering a few questions in this
vein? I'm not looking for commercial secrets, but I'm interested in how you
pitch work like 100,000 Lux and Other while maintaining your identity as a
"regular" (for lack of a better term) games developer.

I'm happy to do it electronically, but if we can arrange a mutually
convenient time and place in Dundee for a meeting, that would be great.
Whatever works for you.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to assuage
any concerns. Thanks for your time, in any case. Hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
Kyle Macquarrie

Hi Mal,
That would be great. I'm pretty flexible as regards time, how would some
time on Thursday work for you? Happy to work around your schedule.
