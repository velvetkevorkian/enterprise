#To do: 
- go through and remove personal pronouns where possible
- anecdotal stuff from internship: importance of linked in, connections etc
- copy relevant bits of bibliography from proposal
- work in nesta toolkit somewhere
- think about presentation — something interactive would be cool, but it does have to work on paper (ask mike?)

##Introduction
Interaction Design is a relatively new field, and is somewhat nebulously defined. We occupy a space "at the intersection of art, media and technology" (Visnjic, date unkown), and expand out to be part of the general creative technology discipline. If we look at previous Digital Interaction Design degree shows, we see a range of designs, from apps to artistic hardware to gestural interfaces. Creative technology is, perhaps more than any other discipline, a synthesis of other areas of design: graphics, products, services, even software. My ultimate goal, however, can be summed up in a simple phrase: to do interesting work using interactive technology, or, to borrow a phrase from the masters, "create beautiful and compelling interactive experiences" (IDEO, date unknown). 

A key strength of a Digital Interaction Design degree can be knowledge of many different interactive technologies. The corollary of this, however, is that it becomes difficult to have in-depth knowledge of a single aspect or piece of technology. Having the opportunity to work in a variety of different jobs, using assorted tools is attractive. The challenge is to ensure that breadth of knowledge doesn't sacrifice depth. For example, Clark (2011), talks about not hiring creative technologists with a breadth of shallow skills- they look for people with excellent technical skills. Although this is in reference to hiring employees, the same criteria are going to be required in freelance work too.

One of the problems for someone trying to enter this area, then, is essentially one of branding. How can one present themselves so that they effectively communicate the work that they do, when most people aren't familiar with either the breadth or depth of that work? How can they attract the kind of work they're interested in, when that work can span such a  wide range? 

This is not a new problem, nor is it one that is unique to the creative technology field. The objective of this report is to investigate how other people have addressed the problems inherent in working across disciplines, and how those lessons can be applied in the modern interaction design/creative technology field. This will include a plan for applying those lessons in my own post-university practice, and will demonstrate some practical applications. I'll also examine some more general issues that arise, with  a particular focus on how they will apply to a business working with creative technology.

###What is branding?
Fundamentally, the issue at stake here is a matter of branding and marketing.  What elements go into making a brand successful, and how can they be applied to a freelance creative technologist's professional identity?

> Branding, in all its shapes and forms, comes down to how an organisation presents itself and, more importantly, how its audience perceives it. It has grown beyond a simple visual depiction into more of an attitude, enforced through a series of interactions a person has with any one organization. (Drew, p.4).

A brand demands consistency across all points of contact. As Drew notes above, the brand identity covers every single aspect of every interaction a person has with a brand. This can be divided into two broad sections (Davis, pp206): firstly, visual guidelines, including usage of a logo, distinctive typography, colour schemes, and so on. For most people, this is probably what they think of when "branding" is mentioned. Secondly, the more ephemeral but no less important aspect of tone of voice, which should be created to complement the visual design. This ensures that the brand's design and language work together to communicate as effectively as possible. 

How can complex multi-layered ideas, like the ones identified earlier, be communicated clearly and effectively? The consensus is that stories are the key.

> Brands start with a great idea that tells a good story. Everybody understands a story — stories cross borders, and they connect generations, class and cultures. Stories are created for their audience and this is what makes them powerful. The story — or narrative — behind a brand is its backbone.  
<br> 
Brands often struggle with trying to be all things to all people. One simple story will help focus the aims of the brand or the brand project and create a single goal. Stories help create simplicity out of complexity by defining a single route through a maze of possibilities, and it is the designer who must translate the story into the visual element and execution. (Davis, p.76)

The stories that others tell about a business can be even more important than the stories a business tells about itself. Precise figures are hard to come by, but Patricia van den Akker of the Design Trust talks about 80% of business coming through referrals. Mike Monteiro says the number is closer to 90% (Monteiro, 2012: p.19). While the people interviewed for this report haven't put a number on it, they have all independently noted that personal connections are vital to getting work. Giving those people an easily told, easily remembered "hook" can be the difference between work coming in from those connections, or not. 

###On making ideas stick
Communicating what we do to people who have little to no awareness of the surrounding area can be problematic. Without a clear and concise explanation, the chances of them understanding what interaction design is are slim — and the chances of getting paid work from them is slimmer still. What we need is a method for making sure our message is easily understood and remembered, without sacrificing accuracy.

Fortunately, there are manuals for this sort of thing. One of these is *Made to Stick*, by the brothers Heath. They propose the concept of "stickiness" — ideas which are both memorable and meaningful — and offer "SUCCESs", a six point checklist for making ideas "sticky":

1. Simplicity
2. Unexpectedness
3. Concreteness
4. Credibility
5. Emotions
6. Stories
7. -

Ideas that don't follow these rules can still stay with people, and we don't necessarily have to check off every point. They do, however, provide a useful guide for how we can communicate complex concepts clearly. Let's have a look at how we can apply the SUCCESs principles to branding and presenting our portfolio website, and telling our professional story. 

####Simplicity
This is one of the key areas for me to focus on. Having an elevator pitch that is as concise as possible is one of the main things currently missing from my professional identity (such as it is). The idea of *interaction designer* or *interactive developer* or *creative technologist* are all complex, multi-level concepts with no canonical definition. Being able to break that down into something that can be understood without additional explanation is vital. It's even more difficult when you're afflicted by what the Heaths refer to as *the curse of knowledge*: once you know something, it's incredibly difficult to imagine not knowing that any more, and as a result we tend to explain things which take for granted that level of knowledge. While complex ideas can be sticky, they arise from layers of simplicity rather than assuming a higher level of knowledge from the start.

####Unexpectedness
The juxtaposition of design and technology that is the creative technologist's trademark can come in useful here. This is, perhaps, an area where having a diversified portfolio can definitely be a strength, not a weakness. 

####Concreteness
Having a portfolio online (rather than, say, just a text heavy CV) goes some way towards providing something concrete for people to relate to. Having projects which are entirely online means people can interact with them directly, increasing their value as evidence. Conversely, some of the more "designy" projects will require some thought about how they're presented to avoid being too abstract. 

####Credibility
Again, having evidence of projects in the wild, and especially some of the commercial work I've done, should provide credibility. 

####Emotions
This is a tricky one. What kind of emotions do I want to evoke with my portfolio (aside from "take my money!")? Awe and wonder would be ideal but depending on that would be hubristic in the extreme.

####Stories
This is the opportunity to tie all the preceding points together. Creating a coherent overall narrative is an opportunity to put the previous points into action, while the stories of individual projects can form layers of depth which reinforce that. 

###Case study: Quartic Llama
[Quartic Llama](http://quarticllama.com/) are a Dundee-based games studio, founded in 2012 by graduates from the University of Abertay. In addition to their, for lack of a better term, "normal" games development work, they also collaborate extensively with cultural organisations, creating games and experiences. I first came across them when their piece [*100,000 Lux*](http://www.northeastofnorth.com/?event=100000-lux) was featured as part of Dundee's 2012 NEoN festival. A site specific performance using the coloured lighting on one of Abertay University's main buildings, combined with a striking soundtrack derived from solar observations, *100,000 Lux* marked Quartic Llama out as not your average game developer. Their collaboration with the National Theatre of Scotland, *Other*, is a location based augmented reality experience set in the streets of Dundee. At first glance it has little in common with either regular games or a piece like *100,000 Lux*, but after talking with Malath Abbas, an artist, designer and one of the founders of Quartic Llama, it's easier to pull together the threads running through their work. 

The identity that Quartic Llama present on their website is actually quite enigmatic. According to Malath, this is a deliberate ploy to draw people in. For him, crafting an image is all about telling a story.

>I think people connect with other people when there's a story, [because] that's how we communicate, mostly through narrative — that's how we pass information on. If you can communicate through narrative, that's awesome.

The Quartic Llama team are careful to tailor that narrative depending on who they're talking to. 

>Your image is so important. Unfortunately it takes a lot of time to get that right, and it's about being careful [about] the messages you send out there. What I do is, depending on who I'm speaking to, I'll do my research before hand. If it's a game publisher, I'll concentrate on our games. If it's an arts or cultural organisation, I'll talk about how we collaborate with people, how we're very artistic... It's about being very careful and doing that research.

This is an important point. Having a selection of messages to tell about your work, tailored to specific audiences, obviously increases the chance of your message finding a receptive audience. 

Having different levels of narrative to expand to can be important too. You can't tell the exact same story in the 160 characters of a Twitter biography that you can in, say, a five minute face-to-face conversation. The layering of simple elements can create a complex overall picture, however, as noted by Heath & Heath (pp48). In fact, this is one of their key points for how make ideas "stick".


###Case Study: Rory Gianni
For a different perspective, I spoke to Rory Gianni, a freelance web developer based out of Dundee's Fleet Collective. Having worked as a technology consultant for a variety of small businesses and startups, he has been moving towards focusing on the sustainability sector. He is also a CleanWeb facilitator, a movement which aims to help solve environmental problems with a combination of technology and design skills. Unlike similar movements, such as "Green IT", they do not focus so heavily on pure engineering solutions, but include elements of design.

This is key to Gianni's attempt to diversify his interests. Although the fact that he is focusing more on sustainability could be seen as a narrowing of his focus, bringing in elements such as service design is widening his role within that sector. This separation between the role of the individual and the industry they're operating in is key to his strategy.  

He did acknowledge the potential pitfalls inherent in this tactic. In narrowing his focus to the sustainability sector, is he discouraging potential clients from outside that area? Will being seen as a specialist in that area attract enough extra work to offset that? These are questions Gianni is grappling with currently, 

Gianni noted that people's perception of you and your work can often have a more significant impact than we might think. Being seen as an organiser or facilitator, a speaker at conferences, or teaching can all make people have a different opinion of you, regardless of the the objective quality of your work. This speaks to the idea of concreteness as suggested by the Heath brothers: if people can associate your work with something they've personally experienced, that can be a big win. 





###Application
We've established what a brand is, why we would want one and how they can be communicated. How can we apply that to my own personal and professional brand? First we'll have a look at my current brand identity, such as it is, and then try and put into practice some of the lessons we've learned. 

####What's my story?

####Benchmarking
Before any design or development project can begin there is a design phase [*design is a job ref?*] First the current presence needs to be assessed to establish how effective it is, before a solution can be proposed.

The presence in question has only had a couple of opportunities to be effective, the most significant being when I successfully applied for an internship with the branding agency Lambie-Nairn. To say that they have a significant amount of experience in creating and designing brands would be an understatement. David Stockfis, who is now a freelance designer but was the design director at Lambie-Nairn in charge of the project, provided some valuable feedback:

>Personal branding's tricky. And somewhat subjective. Some people/studios love a high-impact over-the-top approach... I personally prefer a much simpler/pared back style e.g not much of a personal brand, simple website or pdf showing your best work, up-to-date LinkedIn etc.       
<br>
I like Kyle's no-nonsense personality, honesty and wit. I think it's important that side of him is visible in his profile and I think it'll help him stand out.
<br>     
For employability I'd suggest he's a bit more prescriptive about his skill set. On his website he talks about 'Making design/web/code/art/sound things.' and 'Finely Crafted Electrons'. It's not really clear that he could knock you up an awesome website. I think he should show some of his work on the homepage too.
<br>    
He might want to look at re-ordering the projects in his portfolio/website as well, depending on the direction he wants to take. If he's looking for more experimental/advanced tech positions keep those first or more commercial web development maybe re-shuffle those to the top etc.

David's analysis is hard to fault. The literal story is unclear; the narrative provided by a portfolio is unnecessarily hidden an extra page deep for no particular reason; the abstract home page design provides little of value, especially as most users won't know (or care) about the randomised properties of the central graphic. 

The point about an "up-to-date LinkedIn" bears further examination. As noted earlier, a brand is not just a visual identity but "an attitude, enforced through a series of interactions a person has with any one organization" (Drew, 2002, p.4).  For our purposes, this includes points of contact such as LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as a professional website and blog, all of which currently have somewhat disparate visual and editorial styles. 

While blogging may not have the cultural significance that it once did, it can still provide a valuable outlet for displaying abilities which may not be obvious from a portfolio. 
>[B]logs have become fantastic PR tools for [a] blogger's business, or their art, or their expertise.  
<br>
Everything that happens on your blog can affect people's perceptions of your reputation and whatever it is you're selling. That's also the case elsewhere online (on social networks, for example), but the difference is that your blog is within your control — it is literally your domain. [Houghton, p.156)

Experiments, small side projects and miscellaneous writings, while not necessarily directly related to client work, can show a wider range of personality and ability than a portfolio alone, which is more constrained by the need to include finished works. Given the importance of communication skills in virtually all fields, having a place to practice writing and show off some ability can be advantageous. If kept up to date, it can also be an indicator of ongoing activity, as opposed to a portfolio site that may only get updated occasionally or not at all, depending on the nature of the work being done.

###Appendix A: Lambie-Nairn/Telefonica internship
Excuse the personal tone of this section, but it seems appropriate as a piece of reflective writing rather than an academic summary. 

I spent the majority of summer 2013 (mid May to mid August) working in London. The client commissioning the project, Telefónica UK, have a number of initiatives aimed at giving young (and in my case, not *so* young) people opportunities in training and work, which come under their commitments to being a sustainable business. As part of this, they commissioned Lambie-Nairn to find two paid interns to design and build Telefónica UK's sustainability report for the year. I was fortunate to be chosen to do the front end development, in partnership with a graphic designer. We worked closely with the client and both the design team at Lambie-Nairn and their digital partners at Morph London. As a result, I got to see how a larger branding agency works, as well as a smaller more specialist digital agency. This has also given me the opportunity to do some freelance development work with the digital agency. From this I can draw a few conclusions: 
- As noted repeatedly, personal contacts are vital. 
- In terms of income, freelancing as a front-end developer would be a viable route for me to take, even if not as a primary goal. 
- Working for a smaller specialist agency is far more appealing to me than being part of a large team.
- The ability to get things done and get them out the door is more important than worrying about the technical minutiae of a particular solution.
- "Soft" skills are even more important. Being able to communicate and work with both clients and other team members is probably the key factor in almost every situation. 

There are also a number of more technical and organisational lessons I learned, from both experience and observation. Unfortunately these are harder to distil into an easily told story, being both dependent on having the context explained, and possibly slightly unflattering to some of those concerned. The stories told publicly about this (great!) experience will have to be selected to reflect that. 

- LinkedIn importance? Anecdotal
