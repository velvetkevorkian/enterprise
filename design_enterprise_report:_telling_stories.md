##Executive Summary 
This report will:
- Examine creative technology in its current form and the difficulties its ephemeral and ill-defined nature presents to practitioners and clients.  
- Take a brief introduction to branding and how it can be applied to creative freelancers.
- See how branding is mainly a matter of telling stories and communicating ideas, and look at some methods for communicating in ways that are clear and memorable.
- Look at some case studies of people and studios who work across different disciplines, and see how they bridge the gaps between them and how they communicate their stories.
- Examine the author's current branding strategy,benchmark its effectiveness, and present a revised strategy for a coherent, professional brand identity.

##Introduction
Working at the intersection of design and technology is not for the faint of heart. The tools and systems in use are constantly evolving. Entire categories of jobs exist which were unthinkable just a few years ago. Many of us entering the industry are doing so with combinations of skills that the job titles generally conferred on people do not adequately describe. In my own field of interaction design and creative technology, there is a spectrum of people, from those who work almost entirely in with early stage wireframes and user journeys at one end, to those coding large scale interactive experiences at the other — and that's without thinking about where those skills overlap in the middle. 

The problem for anyone trying to enter this area, then, is essentially one of branding. How can someone present themselves so that they effectively communicate the work that they do, when most people aren't familiar with either the breadth or depth of that work? How can they attract the kind of work they're interested in, when that work can span such a  wide range? 

This is not a new problem, nor is it one that is unique to the creative technology field. My objective is to investigate how other people have addressed the problems inherent in being trans-disciplinary, and how we can apply those lessons in the modern interaction design/creative technology field. The end product will be a plan for applying those lessons in my own post-university practice, and demonstrate some practical applications. I'll also examine some more general issues that arise, with  a particular focus on how they will apply to a business working with creative technology.

##Middle bit (provisional title)


###On making ideas stick
Communicating what we do to people who have little to no awareness of the surrounding area can be problematic. Without a clear and concise explanation, the chances of them understanding what interaction design is are slim — and the chances of getting paid work from them is slimmer still. What we need is a method for making sure our message is easily understood and remembered, without sacrificing accuracy.

Fortunately, there are manuals for this sort of thing. One of these is *Made to Stick*, by the brothers Heath. They propose the concept of "stickiness" — ideas which are both memorable and meaningful — and offer "SUCCESs", a six point checklist for making ideas "sticky":

1. Simplicity
2. Unexpectedness
3. Concreteness
4. Credibility
5. Emotions
6. Stories
7. s

Ideas that don't follow these rules can still stay with people, and we don't necessarily have to check off every point. They do, however, provide a useful guide for how we can communicate complex concepts clearly. Let's have a look at how we can apply the SUCCESs principles to branding and presenting our portfolio website, and telling our professional story. 

####Simplicity
This is one of the key areas for me to focus on. Having an elevator pitch that is as concise as possible is one of the main things currently missing from my professional identity (such as it is). The idea of *interaction designer* or *interactive developer* or *creative technologist* are all complex, multi-level concepts with no canonical definition. Being able to break that down into something that can be understood without additional explanation is vital. It's even more difficult when you're afflicted by what the Heaths refer to as *the curse of knowledge*: once you know something, it's incredibly difficult to imagine not knowing that any more, and as a result we tend to explain things which take for granted that level of knowledge. While complex ideas can be sticky, they arise from layers of simplicity rather than assuming a higher level of knowledge from the start.

####Unexpectedness
The juxtaposition of design and technology that is the creative technologist's trademark can come in useful here. This is, perhaps, an area where having a diversified portfolio can definitely be a strength, not a weakness. 

####Concreteness
Having a portfolio online (rather than, say, just a text heavy CV) goes some way towards providing something concrete for people to relate to. Having projects which are entirely online means people can interact with them directly, increasing their value as evidence. Conversely, some of the more "designy" projects will require some thought about how they're presented to avoid being too abstract. 

####Credibility
Again, having evidence of projects in the wild, and especially some of the commercial work I've done, should provide credibility. 

####Emotions
This is a tricky one. What kind of emotions do I want to evoke with my portfolio (aside from "take my money!")? Awe and wonder would be ideal but depending on that would be hubristic in the extreme.

####Stories
This is the opportunity to tie all the preceding points together. Creating a coherent overall narrative is an opportunity to put the previous points into action, while the stories of individual projects can form layers of depth which reinforce that. 

###Case study: Quartic Llama
For some insight into the importance of stories and how we tell them, I got in touch with [Quartic Llama](http://quarticllama.com/), a Dundee-based games studio, founded in 2012 by graduates from the University of Abertay. In addition to their, for lack of a better term, "normal" games development work, they also collaborate extensively with cultural organisations, creating games and experiences. I first came across them when their piece [*100,000 Lux*](http://www.northeastofnorth.com/?event=100000-lux) was featured as part of Dundee's 2012 NEoN festival. A site specific performance using the coloured lighting on one of Abertay University's main buildings, combined with a striking soundtrack derived from solar observations, *100,000 Lux* marked Quartic Llama out as not your average game developer. Their collaboration with the National Theatre of Scotland, *Other*, is a location based augmented reality experience set in the streets of Dundee. At first glance it has little in common with either regular games or a piece like *100,000 Lux*, but after talking with Malath Abbas, an artist, designer and one of the founders of Quartic Llama, it's easier to pull together the threads running through their work. 

The identity that Quartic Llama present on their website is actually quite enigmatic. According to Malath, this is a deliberate ploy to draw people in. For him, crafting an image is all about telling a story.

>I think people connect with other people when there's a story, [because] that's how we communicate, mostly through narrative — that's how we pass information on. If you can communicate through narrative, that's awesome.

The Quartic Llama team are careful to tailor that narrative depending on who they're talking to. 

>Your image is so important. Unfortunately it takes a lot of time to get that right, and it's about being careful [about] the messages you send out there. What I do is, depending on who I'm speaking to, I'll do my research before hand. If it's a game publisher, I'll concentrate on our games. If it's an arts or cultural organisation, I'll talk about how we collaborate with people, how we're very artistic... It's about being very careful and doing that research.

I think this is an important point. Having a selection of messages to tell about your work, tailored to specific audiences, obviously increases the chance of your message finding a receptive audience. 

Having different levels of narrative to expand to can be important too. You can't tell the exact same story in the 160 characters of a Twitter biography that you can in, say, a five minute face-to-face conversation. The layering of simple elements can create a complex overall picture, however, as noted by Heath & Heath (pp48). In fact, this is one of their key points for how make ideas "stick".


###Case Study: Rory Gianni
For a different perspective, I spoke to Rory Gianni, a freelance web developer based out of Dundee's Fleet Collective. Having worked as a technology consultant for a variety of small businesses and startups, he has been moving towards focusing on the sustainability sector. He is also a CleanWeb facilitator, a movement which aims to help solve environmental problems with a combination of technology and design skills. Unlike similar movements, such as "Green IT", they do not focus so heavily on pure engineering solutions, but include elements of design.

This is key to Gianni's attempt to diversify his interests. Although the fact that he is focusing more on sustainability could be seen as a narrowing of his focus, bringing in elements such as service design is widening his role within that sector. This separation between the role of the individual and the industry they're operating in is key to his strategy.  

He did acknowledge the potential pitfalls inherent in this tactic. In narrowing his focus to the sustainability sector, is he discouraging potential clients from outside that area? Will being seen as a specialist in that area attract enough extra work to offset that? These are questions Gianni is grappling with currently, 

Gianni noted that people's perception of you and your work can often have a more significant impact than we might think. Being seen as an organiser or facilitator, a speaker at conferences, or teaching can all make people have a different opinion of you, regardless of the the objective quality of your work. This speaks to the idea of concreteness as suggested by the Heath brothers: if people can associate your work with something they've personally experienced, that can be a big win. 


###What is branding?
Fundamentally, the issue at stake here is a matter of branding and marketing.  What elements go into making a brand successful, and how relevant are they to a freelance worker's professional identity?

> Branding, in all its shapes and forms, comes down to how an organisation presents itself and, more importantly, how its audience perceives it. It has grown beyond a simple visual depiction into more of an attitude, enforced through a series of interactions a person has with any one organization [sic] (Drew, pp4).

So, for our purposes, we can think of it as an issue of communication design. What do we need to communicate? 

- What we do
- What we've done
- Why you would want us to do it for you. 

How can we communicate complex ideas and information? As we've established, stories are the key.

> Brands start with a great idea that tells a good story. Everybody understands a story — stories cross borders, and they connect generations, class and cultures. Stories are created for their audience and this is what makes them powerful. The story — or narrative — behind a brand is its backbone.  

> Brands often struggle with trying to be all things to all people. One simple story will help focus the aims of the brand or the brand project and create a single goal. Stories help create simplicity out of complexity by defining a single route through a maze of possibilities, and it is the designer who must translate the story into the visual element and execution. (Davis, pp76)

As we've seen before, stories are key to communication. For many brands, the way stories are told is tightly managed so as to reinforce the main narrative. During my internship in summer 2013, the client I worked with was a major UK telecoms company, who run regular tone-of-voice workshops for all employees. This ensures a single consistent narrative for all the company's communications, regardless of which employee wrote a particular piece or what department they work for. 

This consistency extends across any visual design elements too, of course. For most people this is probably what they think of when "branding" is mentioned: the look and feel of a product or service. 




###Application
We've established what a brand is, why we would want one and how they can be communicated. How can we apply that to my own personal and professional brand? First we'll have a look at my current brand identity, such as it is, and then try and put into practice some of the lessons we've learned. 

####Benchmarking
First we need to assess how effective my current presence is.
