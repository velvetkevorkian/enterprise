#Quartic Llama interview: 17/10/2013
featuring: 
    Malath Abbas (MA)
    Kyle Macquarrie (KM)
    
KM: Do you guys still pitch yourself as a games design company, a games studio?

MA: Yes, we're still very much... "Quartic Llama: We make games". That's our tagline. Our focus has always been games, I think it will continue to be games. However, I guess we're not your normal games development studio.We have a very creative core team, and our skillset and our interests are not just traditional games. It goes beyond that. But we still see ourselves as games people. We're aware that we could easily be labelled as non-traditional, which is fine, we do non-traditional things; however, we do traditional things as well. It's always been an issue with trying to make sure we're on the line, we don't want to be in one or the other exclusively, we want to be in both camps. 

KM: You see that as something to chase after, straddling that line, you can go either way? 

MA: For me it's not a case of going either way, it's a case of going both ways at the same time. I think we're quite open minded, we don't want to be too narrow, to home in on one thing in particular, generally speaking. The team is four co-founders, two excellent programmers who do design as well, they're engine-level programmers; and we've got two artists, myself and Tom. I'm quite a technical artist, I've done programming as well, I'm a designer as well, and Tom is design, audio and visuals, all in one as well, so we're quite multi-talented in that regard. It's a case of using that skillset, that wide skillset, to engage people with interactive experiences. Where they ultimately stand is up to the player. We just made this game called *Other* with the National Theatre, and people finish it and start asking the question "Is it a game or is it an experience?" I personally think it's game, other people can think it's an experience, that's not a problem. I was really proud of the fact that we started that conversation. To me it's creating these things that make people question these boundaries, and reassess them. These things are changing all the time, games as a medium is so young that I don't want to be put in a box now, because that box is going to disappear in no time, so we're just focusing on being creative people. 

KM: When I first heard of you it was when you were doing 100,000 Lux, which is probably "not a game"(!). First of all how do you get work like that, is that just something that comes through personal contacts? Or does someone come to you and say, "Hey, we've got these lights..."?

MA: I think it's a case of knowing people and being involved in different things. That was part of NEoN digital festival, which we're quite heavily involved with. We're always involved in different capacities: this year I'm helping do a thing called Drop In And Play, which is very game specific; people come show off their games at the DCA, so it's very gamey. But 100,000 Lux was more a collaboration, when we first started the company; that really came to us when we were students, actually, and that was because we knew certain people, we'd collaborated with them before. That was basically our programmers using their skillset to do something quite artistic and creative, so that was a bit of fun that we had with that. We're always doing these kind of projects; some we talk about and some we don't talk about, because we are all creatives; even though we have programmers and artists, we are all very creative, we have our own things we like and things we want to do, so we set up the company to make games and allow us to be creative in our individual capacities as well. But I would say it goes down to past experience and personal contacts. 

KM: SO it's not like someone's putting out a tender, saying "We want an augmented reality experience for our play"?

MA: Well, it's very difficult. The projects we've done over the past year, be it experiences like lightshows or our core games, we've done a few tendered things, and we've been successful so far in everything we've applied for. But those things tend to be quite restricted. 

KM: They already know what they're looking for?

MA: Pretty much, mostly, and they've all been quite gamey. When it comes to visual arts, and the more general sphere, I think it would be difficult for us as games people to guarantee that we're going to land a contract that's like a different light show without knowing people. But also it helps that we've done stuff in the past now. By adding to our portfolio we can explain to people that we do get it, we can do this kind of stuff. But, I think, without having those initial contacts in the first place, we wouldn't be where we are right now. 

KM: It gets you off the ground. 

MA: Yeah. Now that we have a bit of a portfolio it makes it easier, but it's still quite challenging, because working in that field are amazing artists, and that's all they do. They understand that world, whereas with us the world of games is slightly different, the funding is slightly different. We are a five man team at the moment, so that's five mouths to feed, so we need to keep money coming in. We do a lot of technical work, which we definitely don't talk about because it's not fun and it's not really interesting. But it pays the bills.

KM: White-labeling stuff for other people?

MA: That kind of stuff. Using our skill-set, whether it's visual, or code, or design, to help people with their projects, and we charge appropriately, so that us as a business can benefit from those contracts. We're not here to do that work, but if that work can help us do our work, so be it. 

KM: That's just something you have to do at this point. 

MA: Yes. It's not easy, it's challenging, but it makes doing your own thing a reality, so it helps. 

KM: I'm interested in how if someone comes to you with a budget for something that doesn't clearly fit into these boxes how you stay within that? Do you say, OK, we'll do this and if you hit some hurdles you just take the hit on that?

MA: I'll give you *Other* as an example of that. That project came to us from a chance meeting; you know how the V&A do these Mash events? I'd recommend you attend, they're great for collaboration. We met the National Theatre guys at one of these, randomly, had a nice conversation. The theatre wanted to come to Dundee, as it started at the Rep, so it had to have a link with Dundee, and they wanted to do community engagement, and they wanted to do something a bit different, something digital, which meant that we could help them out. 

Essentially what they wanted was a very traditional augmented reality, QR codes and treasure hunting kind of stuff. That's what they wanted. We sat down with their ideas and the general theme of the project and we said to them, actually, we'd rather do something a bit different, a bit more innovative, and we think we can do that. Brand new, never been done before. So they trusted us. We had a good relation from the very start, they trusted us. The budget was not very good, it wasn't great; it's never great but this one in particular was quite low. But we realised early on, by working with the National Theatre, it would do our profile a huge plus. But we knew to a certain extent that we would be taking a hit, because we could do technical work which would pay us a lot more money, but this would be creative work, so it would be a fun project, and it would get our name out there in the press. So we took that on knowing that, and thankfully it worked out, because it actually became a full on partnership. It wasn't just this company and that company, it was the National Theatre *and*, in partnership with Quartic Llama, which for a studio under a year old is unheard of, really. So we did a good job of that, I think. 

Then it was a case of, we'd kind of set the bar high for ourselves, we knew there was going to be attention on the project, so we just put the hours in, put the effort in, to create something good and a bit new. It was a very challenging project, cos it was new territory we'd never done before, but we realised that audio and location, the combination of the two is very engaging. Once we realised that it was just a case of making a fun experience kind of thing. 

KM: Do you ever think that having this range of skills can be a weakness? If someone's looking for a game they won't come to you?

MA: That is definitely a fear. We are always careful with what we talk about, and what we push, and we try and keep it balanced. For example, when *Other* came out, we had a guy from PocketGamer come up to play the game. PocketGamer is a big mobile based review website. We used that as an opportunity to not only promote *Other* as a game but also to promote ourselves and our other games, which are a bit more traditional turn based stuff, all kinds of games that we do which are a bit more traditional. So we used that opportunity, and it worked; we got a company profile, and those other games got talked about. It's about using that opportunity you have carefully. Your image is so important. Unfortunately it takes a lot of time to get that right, and it's about being careful the messages you send out there. What I do is, depending on who I'm speaking to, I'll do my research before hand. If it's a game publisher, I'll concentrate on our games. If it's an arts or cultural organisation, I'll talk about how we collaborate with people, how we're very artistic and that kind of stuff. It's about being very careful and doing that research. 

Our Facebook page is essentially "Hey, we had more cake today!"- it's very fun and relaxed. Twitter is news once in a while, and our website is the main portal. It has some information about the game, or it has a trailer; we don't overwhelm people. I think you need to leave it a bit mysterious so people actually look into it. 

KM: Having that mystery thing is quite interesting. Do you think that can apply to other fields as well? 

MA: I think so. I think it's more about having a story, having a narrative, whatever that is. Whether it's a mystery, or a story, your day to day life, whatever it might be. I think people connect with other people when there's a story, cos that's how we communicate, mostly through narrative- that's how we pass information on. If you can communicate either you, if you're selling yourself, or your job or your skillset, through narrative, that's awesome. That's why people follow certain people on Twitter, it's a narrative of someone's day to day life, or their opinions, it's all about conveying narrative somehow. Whether it's in a mysterious way depends on your audience, I guess. 

KM: Yeah, I've been trying to redevelop my identity and it's like, what do I put in that one line on my website? This is what I do, but without just being a bulleted list- design, development, whatever. How do you make that an engaging story? 

MA: Exactly. And that line for us, we've been working on that line for the past fourteen months, and it changes depending on who we're speaking to. If it's a funding body, it this that and the other, it's all about who you're speaking to. On our website, when we're speaking to everyone, we keep it very broad, but when we're speaking face to face or in an email we'll be more specific. With your website, is your aim to get work through that? 

KM: Ultimately, yeah.

MA: And who would you want to be working for, or with?

KM: I think my ideal goal would be creative technollogy, working with cultural organisations and things. But at the same time I do some freelancing, front-end development stuff, to pay the bills. It's choosing how to balance those, or which one to emphasise. That freelance work has come through contacts.

MA: It mostly does. You build up a reputation, your name spreads. It's really important. 

KM: I think that's going to be one of the deliverables at the end of this module, a plan for how to communicate that and some evidence of that. 

MA: I think someone in your field, your website has to basically be shit-hot. Visually it has to be up to date as far what every other designer's doing. We know all the new trends that are coming up that the UX guys are doing, that will filter down into games and technology and film and all this kind of stuff, it's just keeping abreast of all that and showing that you are aware of these trends and upcoming things. It's about having something that's not too flashy, quite minimalist and straight to the point. The whole mystery thing is, some people like to hide behind a label or a handle or a mask or whatever, or there's the opposite where people put their face up. People do connect to faces as human beings, that does work, but not everyone is a fan of that, so that's a choice you have to make. 

KM: Yeah, I've ben cutting it down. I used to have home and portfolio and about and contact, and I've been trying to condense that all down to one page- condensing that narrative into as little as possible. As much as needs to be said and no more. Choosing the elements to emphasise is the main thing. 

Are you still working with NEoN etc, is that something that's ongoing? 

MA: Yeah, it's part of what we do, it's something that we do on the side. The more stable we are as a business, the more we'll probably do that kind of stuff, cos it's fun and you're working with awesome people in different fields, which is interesting. 
[some chat about the Abertay Christmas stuff: 
I'm really interested in anything interactive, especially if it's a spectacle, but I'm not sure if we have the time or the money.

KM: Technical hurdles again.

MA: It's just time. We've got other projects on, and we've got to pay the bills, and we've got other projects on so we've got to manage that time correctly. You don't want to be in a position where you drop the ball on one project because it's all based on your name, your reputation, you've got to keep your standards really high. There's no other way to get more work. 

KM: Do you ever feel like there's a difficulty in keeping those standards high across the board? So your technical work is as good as the artistic side of things? 

MA: Normally, if we're in control we have no issue with that, it's all systems firing. But then, we've just done a game for Aberdeen City Council which was work for hire, small project, pays the bills, and it was very much what they wanted. It's difficult when you suggest things, and we think we're the experts in engagement and games for kids, which we've done before, and you offer suggestions and the client's like "No, I want this". That can be quite frustrating, because you have to do what the client says, it's their project. It comes down to communication skills, how do you communicate something with the client in such a way that they listen, appreciate your opinion and stuff. I do a lot of that and it's stuff I'm aware of, but when you're involved in a startup there's a lot of stress because there's so much going on at once, so you're not able to spend the time communicating properly with someone. You've got to send the email and be done with it. That can be quite challenging, the outcome can be something you're not always happy with; but the client is over the moon with it. Personally you might not be happy with it.

KM: It's not something you'd want as a portfolio piece. 

MA: No. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. We did a game with the National Museum in Edinburgh, and those guys were like, "OK, there's the budget, go ahead". You do games, do it. Come up with the idea, we'll approve it, go for it. We were quite happy with that project. It's not what we do, it was a kids game, but it was a fun project, it worked, it got a good response, so we were very happy to share that with the world. It was a good story for us, cos it was us with a national body again. This time, with Aberdeen City COuncil, I don't think we'll be sharing it too much. We did it all, but it was mostly their ideas. It's nothing terrible, but it's not something I'm hugely proud of. You've got to pick and choose. 

KM: I was working at an agency over the summer where they had twice as many people talking to clients as designing. 

MA: It's crazy isn't it. It's unbelievably time consuming. Bizarrely enough, especially on small projects with a small budget, the client seems to think they can have more of a say. Generally speaking, when you're dealing with arts and cultural organisations there's a big gap- "Can you make this happen?"- because they don't have the technical understanding. TO them, there's no difference between selecting between two different characters or a character customisation system. For them it's one or the other, and they both take a day to make, that's fine. It's like no, that's not how it works, and it's having to explain to people in that position. You can't be a dick about it, because that's not their field. They know their field more than you; you could never know what they know, so you've got to be respectful to people always. It's about communication, using the appropriate language. If you say to me UX design I get that, but someone else, they'll be like what does that mean?

KM: Yeah, that's exactly the issue that we have. Especially since I don't actually like UX design that much, I prefer the slightly more technical side of it. Everyone on my course is going to have a slightly different narrative about what they ge from it.

MA: That's good, you need that diversity. I like Dundee because it's full of games developers. It spurs you on, because it's competition, but we're all slightly different. Some people might not see that, but I definitely think we stand out a lot from the Dundee crowd. The Dundee crowd is very technical, technically they cover the board really really well. I think we're technically just as good as most of the competition, but creatively we're a bit different, we're a bit more I think, we are doing something a bit different. Most games companies havent done 100,000 Lux. That wasn't even the artists in Quartic Llama, that was the programmers, so it just shows you how creative we are collectively. 

[some chat about Junkfish]

MA: It's not easy starting any kind of business in today's climate, but it is possible. I guess you're more a one man band?

KM: Probably. 

MA: I think you're in a very interesting field. It's something I might have been doing if I wasn't doing games. I'm really interested in narrative, narrative through interaction, and I really like working with people, so games development's pefect for me. It's also the fact that it's challenging, because things are changing all the time. It's never set, we're constantly doing new things, new tech, new business models, everything, and I like that state of flux. For you it's a very interesting field, and it's not easy, because any kind of creative endeavour in today's economy's not easy, but it's all on you to get out there, get your name out there, do as many projects as you can, put together not necessarily a huge but a high quality, professional portfolio as soon as you can and start collaborating with people. Whether that's doing it for free or not great money, you have to start somewhere. 

KM: Get your name out there, get people to tell other people, refer you on.

MA: Yeah. Word of mouth is by far the strongest way of getting yourself heard.
