##Introduction
Interaction Design is a relatively new field, and is somewhat nebulously defined. We occupy a space "at the intersection of art, media and technology" (Visnjic, date unkown), and expand out to be part of the wider creative technology discipline. If we look at previous Digital Interaction Design degree shows, we see a range of designs, from apps to artistic hardware to gestural interfaces and websites. Creative technology is, perhaps more than any other discipline, a synthesis of other areas of design: graphics, products, services, even software. My ultimate goal, however, can be summed up in a simple phrase: to do interesting work using interactive technology, or, to borrow a phrase from the masters, "create beautiful and compelling interactive experiences" (IDEO, date unknown). 

A key strength of a Digital Interaction Design degree is a knowledge of many different interactive technologies. The corollary of this, however, is that it becomes difficult to have in-depth knowledge of a single aspect or piece of technology. Having the opportunity to work in a variety of different jobs, using assorted tools is attractive. The challenge is to ensure that breadth of knowledge doesn't sacrifice depth. For example, Clark (2011), talks about not hiring creative technologists with a breadth of shallow skills — they look for people with excellent technical skills. Although this is in reference to hiring employees, the same criteria are going to be required in freelance work too.

One of the problems for someone trying to enter this area, then, is essentially one of branding. How can one present themselves so that they effectively communicate the work that they do, when most people aren't familiar with either the breadth or depth of that work? How can they attract the kind of work they're interested in, when that work can span such a  wide range? 

This is not a new problem, nor is it one that is unique to the creative technology field. The objective of this report is to investigate how other people have addressed the problems inherent in working across disciplines, and how those lessons can be applied in the modern interaction design/creative technology field. This will include a plan for applying those lessons in my own post-university practice, and will demonstrate some practical applications. I'll also examine some more general issues that arise, with  a particular focus on how they will apply to a business working with creative technology.

##Middle bit (provisional title)

###What is branding?
Fundamentally, the issue at stake here is a matter of branding and marketing.  What elements go into making a brand successful, and how can they be applied to a freelance creative technologist's professional identity?

> Branding, in all its shapes and forms, comes down to how an organisation presents itself and, more importantly, how its audience perceives it. It has grown beyond a simple visual depiction into more of an attitude, enforced through a series of interactions a person has with any one organization. (Drew, p.4).

A brand demands consistency across all points of contact. As Drew notes above, the brand identity covers every single aspect of every interaction a person has with a brand. This can be divided into two broad sections (Davis, p.206): firstly, visual guidelines, including usage of a logo, distinctive typography, colour schemes, and so on. For most people, this is probably what they think of when "branding" is mentioned. Secondly, the more ephemeral but no less important aspect of tone of voice, which should be created to complement the visual design. This ensures that the brand's design and language work together to communicate as effectively as possible. 

How can complex multi-layered ideas, like the ones identified earlier, be communicated clearly and effectively? The consensus is that stories are the key.

> Brands start with a great idea that tells a good story. Everybody understands a story — stories cross borders, and they connect generations, class and cultures. Stories are created for their audience and this is what makes them powerful. The story — or narrative — behind a brand is its backbone.  
<br> 
Brands often struggle with trying to be all things to all people. One simple story will help focus the aims of the brand or the brand project and create a single goal. Stories help create simplicity out of complexity by defining a single route through a maze of possibilities, and it is the designer who must translate the story into the visual element and execution. (Davis, p.76)

The stories that others tell about a business can be even more important than the stories a business tells about itself. Precise figures are hard to come by, but Patricia van den Akker of the Design Trust talks about 80% of business coming through referrals. Mike Monteiro says the number is closer to 90% (Monteiro, 2012: p.19). While the people interviewed for this report haven't put a number on it, they have all independently noted that personal connections are vital to getting work. Giving those people an easily told, easily remembered "hook" can be the difference between work coming in from those connections, or not. 

###On making ideas stick
Communicating what we do to people who have little to no awareness of the surrounding area can be problematic. Without a clear and concise explanation, the chances of them understanding what interaction design is are slim — and the chances of getting paid work from them is slimmer still. What we need is a method for making sure our message is easily understood and remembered, without sacrificing accuracy.

Fortunately, there are manuals for this sort of thing. One of these is *Made to Stick*, by Chip and Dan Heath (Heath, 2004). They propose the concept of "stickiness" — ideas which are both memorable and meaningful — and offer "SUCCES", a six point checklist for making ideas "sticky":

1. Simplicity
2. Unexpectedness
3. Concreteness
4. Credibility
5. Emotions
6. Stories

Ideas that don't follow these rules can still stay with people, and we don't necessarily have to check off every point. They do, however, provide a useful guide for how we can communicate complex concepts clearly. Let's have a look at how we can apply the SUCCESs principles to branding and presenting our portfolio website, and telling our professional story. 

1. **Simplicity**  
This is one of the key areas for me to focus on. Having an elevator pitch that is as concise as possible is one of the main things currently missing from my professional identity (such as it is). The idea of *interaction designer* or *interactive developer* or *creative technologist* are all complex, multi-level concepts with no canonical definition. Being able to break that down into something that can be understood without additional explanation is vital. It's even more difficult when you're afflicted by what the Heaths refer to as *the curse of knowledge*: once you know something, it's incredibly difficult to imagine not knowing that any more, and as a result we tend to explain things which take for granted that level of knowledge. While complex ideas can be sticky, they arise from layers of simplicity rather than assuming a higher level of knowledge from the start.

1. **Unexpectedness**  
The juxtaposition of design and technology that is the creative technologist's trademark can come in useful here. This is, perhaps, an area where having a diversified portfolio can definitely be a strength, not a weakness. 

3. **Concreteness**  
Having a portfolio online (rather than, say, just a text heavy CV) goes some way towards providing something concrete for people to relate to. Having projects which are entirely online means people can interact with them directly, increasing their value as evidence. Conversely, some of the more "designy" projects will require some thought about how they're presented to avoid being too abstract. 

4. **Credibility**  
Again, having evidence of projects in the wild, and especially some of the commercial work I've done, should provide credibility. 

5. **Emotions**  
This is a tricky one. What kind of emotions do I want to evoke with my portfolio (aside from "take my money!")? Awe and wonder would be ideal but depending on that would be hubristic in the extreme.

6. **Stories**
This is the opportunity to tie all the preceding points together. Creating a coherent overall narrative is an opportunity to put the previous points into action, while the stories of individual projects can form layers of depth which reinforce that. 


###Approaches to branding
While the creative technology industry is relatively small, many of the people working in the field are quite accessible. Although a lot of work happens out of the public eye within agencies, and thus goes uncredited, there are enough influential freelancers with online presences that it is possible to get a flavour of how they brand themselves publicly. As this collection of online portfolios and interviews shows, there are a number of different approaches one can take to telling the story of who you are and what you do. 


####Case Study: Brendan Dawes
Brendan Dawes is one of the best known figures in the creative technology space, having written several books on interaction design and innovative uses of Flash. He was creative director at the digital agency Magnetic North before going freelance in 2012. His brief introduction is an effective summary of what he does:

>Brendan Dawes is a designer and artist exploring the interaction of objects, people, technology and art using an eclectic mix of digital and analog materials, for himself and for clients around the globe. (Dawes, date unknown)

This no-nonsense approach mirrors Dawes' straightforward personal style, evident in his talks and writings (e.g. Dawes, 2007). The message is clear-cut, and the graphic style is simple but effective. His work is mostly allowed to carry the narrative. In terms of the SUCCES checklist, he scores highly for concreteness (thanks to the number of portfolio pieces), credibility, and stories: every piece he points to has its own story behind it. 

####Case Study: Stefan Goodchild
Stefan Goodchild brands himself as TripleGeek, and his website shows off the diverse range of work he produces. This is useful for me, as his range of work is similar to my own. How does he pitch himself? 

>My name is Stefan Goodchild and I'm a freelance creative coder, motion graphics & interaction designer, living in Bristol, UK  
<br>
I create motion graphics and real time interactive visuals with code using Processing and openFrameworks for concerts, installations, television, and conferences.

Again, the work is the main focus of Goodchild's brand identity, although he uses a more distinctive graphic style, with a striking pink highlight colour used to accent the otherwise restrained palette, and a nicely designed logo with both static (for the website) and animated (for his showreel) versions. 

Goodchild's use of "creative coder" as a descriptor is interesting. Originating with John Maeda's work at MIT's Aesthetic Computation Group on the late 90s, the term is widely used to describe programming for design and artistic purposes (Maeda, 2004). It is not without its issues, though: it pejoratively insinuates that code can be divided into "creative" and "non-creative" segments, whereas in practice almost all coding is an act of creative problem solving, even in cases where the end product is not especially interesting. 

Nonetheless, the focus on technical skills is valuable, given that major agencies like Wieden & Kennedy are coming round to the idea that they will "[o]nly hire people to work at the crossover of creative and technology if they have strong, practical, current coding skills" (Clark, 2011). The phrase is prominent in industry conferences (e.g. Bell, 2012) and in general discourse (e.g. Cinder, date unknown), so there may well be a case to be made for using "creative coding" as a way of differentiating from creative disciplines with less technical emphasis.
  


####Case study: Quartic Llama
Quartic Llama are a Dundee-based games studio, founded in 2012 by graduates from the University of Abertay. In addition to their, for lack of a better term, "normal" games development work, they also collaborate extensively with cultural organisations, creating games and experiences. I first came across them when their piece *100,000 Lux* was featured as part of Dundee's 2012 NEoN festival. A site specific performance using the coloured lighting on one of Abertay University's main buildings, combined with a striking soundtrack derived from solar observations, *100,000 Lux* marked Quartic Llama out as not your average game developer. Their collaboration with the National Theatre of Scotland, *Other*, is a location based augmented reality experience set in the streets of Dundee. At first glance it has little in common with either regular games or a piece like *100,000 Lux*, but after talking with Malath Abbas, an artist, designer and one of the founders of Quartic Llama, it's easier to pull together the threads running through their work. 

The identity that Quartic Llama present on their website is actually quite enigmatic. According to Malath, this is a deliberate ploy to draw people in. For him, crafting an image is all about telling a story.

>I think people connect with other people when there's a story, [because] that's how we communicate, mostly through narrative — that's how we pass information on. If you can communicate through narrative, that's awesome.

The Quartic Llama team are careful to tailor that narrative depending on who they're talking to. 

>Your image is so important. Unfortunately it takes a lot of time to get that right, and it's about being careful [about] the messages you send out there. What I do is, depending on who I'm speaking to, I'll do my research before hand. If it's a game publisher, I'll concentrate on our games. If it's an arts or cultural organisation, I'll talk about how we collaborate with people, how we're very artistic... It's about being very careful and doing that research.

This is an important point. Having a selection of messages to tell about your work, tailored to specific audiences, obviously increases the chance of your message finding a receptive audience. 

Having different levels of narrative to expand to can be important too. You can't tell the exact same story in the 160 characters of a Twitter biography that you can in, say, a five minute face-to-face conversation. The layering of simple elements can create a complex overall picture, however. (Heath, 2004, p.48). In fact, this is identified as one of the key points for how to make ideas "stick".


####Case Study: Rory Gianni
For a different perspective, I spoke to Rory Gianni, a freelance web developer based out of Dundee's Fleet Collective. Having worked as a technology consultant for a variety of small businesses and startups, he has been moving towards focusing on the sustainability sector. He is also a CleanWeb facilitator, a movement which aims to help solve environmental problems with a combination of technology and design skills. Unlike similar movements, such as "Green IT", they do not focus so heavily on pure engineering solutions, but include elements of design.

This is key to Gianni's attempt to diversify his interests. Although the fact that he is focusing more on sustainability could be seen as a narrowing of his focus, bringing in elements such as service design is widening his role within that sector. This separation between the role of the individual and the industry they're operating in is key to his strategy.  

He did acknowledge the potential pitfalls inherent in this tactic. In narrowing his focus to the sustainability sector, is he discouraging potential clients from outside that area? Will being seen as a specialist in that area attract enough extra work to offset that? These are questions Gianni is grappling with currently, 

Gianni also noted that people's perception of you and your work can often have a more significant impact than we might think. Being seen as an organiser or facilitator, a speaker at conferences, or teaching can all make people have a higher opinion of you, regardless of the the objective quality of your work. This speaks to the idea of concreteness as suggested by the Heath brothers: if people can associate your work with something they've personally experienced, that can be a big win. 


###Application
Having established what a brand is, why they are important for freelancers, and how they can be communicated, how can we apply that to my own personal and professional brand? First we'll have a look at my current brand identity, such as it is, and then try and put into practice some of the lessons we've learned. 


####Benchmarking
Before any branding project can begin there is a research phase — the current brand identity and its applications needs to be assessed to establish how effective it is, before a solution can be proposed (Hall 2013, pp.215-219).

The presence in question has only had a couple of opportunities to be effective, the most significant being the summer of 2013, as part of a successful application for an internship with the branding agency Lambie-Nairn. David Stockfis, who is now a freelance designer but was the design director at Lambie-Nairn in charge of the project, provided some valuable feedback:

>Personal branding's tricky. And somewhat subjective. Some people/studios love a high-impact over-the-top approach... I personally prefer a much simpler/pared back style e.g not much of a personal brand, simple website or pdf showing your best work, up-to-date LinkedIn etc.       
<br>
I like Kyle's no-nonsense personality, honesty and wit. I think it's important that side of him is visible in his profile and I think it'll help him stand out.
<br>     
For employability I'd suggest he's a bit more prescriptive about his skill set. On his website he talks about 'Making design/web/code/art/sound things.' and 'Finely Crafted Electrons'. It's not really clear that he could knock you up an awesome website. I think he should show some of his work on the homepage too.
<br>    
He might want to look at re-ordering the projects in his portfolio/website as well, depending on the direction he wants to take. If he's looking for more experimental/advanced tech positions keep those first or more commercial web development maybe re-shuffle those to the top etc.

David's analysis is hard to fault. The literal story the site tries to tell is unclear, with the tagline obscuring more than it explains. Although this can be a valid tactic (as in the case of Quartic Llama, as we saw earlier) it's not ideal in a context where explaining what's on offer is already difficult. The narrative provided by the elements of a portfolio is unnecessarily hidden an extra page deep for no good reason; the abstract home page design offers little of value, especially as most users won't know (or care) about the randomised properties of the central graphic. The information architecture, user experience and visual design will need updated to be more effective. 

####Other Venues

David's point about an "up-to-date LinkedIn" bears further examination. As noted earlier, a brand is not just a visual identity but "an attitude, enforced through a series of interactions a person has with any one organization" (Drew, 2002, p.4).  For our purposes, this includes points of contact such as LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as a professional website and blog, all of which currently have somewhat disparate visual and editorial styles. 

While blogging may not have the cultural significance that it once did, it can still provide a valuable outlet for displaying abilities which may not be obvious from a portfolio.

>[B]logs have become fantastic PR tools for [a] blogger's business, or their art, or their expertise.  
<br>
Everything that happens on your blog can affect people's perceptions of your reputation and whatever it is you're selling. That's also the case elsewhere online (on social networks, for example), but the difference is that your blog is within your control — it is literally your domain. [Houghton, p.156)

Experiments, small side projects and miscellaneous writings, while not necessarily directly related to client work, can show a wider range of personality and ability than a portfolio alone, which is more constrained by the need to include finished works. Given the importance of communication skills in virtually all fields, having a place to practice writing and demonstrate one's abilities can be advantageous. If kept up to date, it can also be an indicator of ongoing activity, as opposed to a portfolio site that may only get updated occasionally or not at all, depending on the nature of the work being done. 

Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the designs of the main website and its associated blog have diverged somewhat, thanks to the relative difficulty of customising Wordpress themes. Unifying them under a single, modernised, branded identity would probably be the change that would have most impact on the online brand presence. 

Other online venues, for example social media like Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+, also benefit from a unified brand identity. Social media is an increasingly powerful tool for recruitment, both for freelancers and people seeking steady employment. My network of choice is Twitter, which is set to see millions of opportunities tweeted in coming years (Pitts, 2014). On a smaller scale, "The web industry runs on [G]ithub [a code sharing site for developers] and [T]witter" (Roberts, 2013).

In these cases, ensuring they all present a common front, at least as far as possible, means making the most of the available customisation options — while these vary from service to service, using a style guide can at least make them as cohesive as possible.

####Values
One of the first exercises featured in the Creative Enterprise Toolkit (Nesta, check date, pp.10-14) is to lay out the values to guide a prospective business. These were the most important things I identified during that exercise:

- Being proud of the things I put into the world. 
- Conversely, not working with clients whose ethics I disagree with.
- Using innovative combinations of design and technology as means for solving problems and creating experiences.
- Contributing back to the open source tools that have allowed me to pursue this path.
- Having a healthy work/life balance.


####What's my story?
So, how can we distil those values into a succinct elevator pitch, taking into account the lessons of our case studies? This is what would go on a business card, for example, or as the single line summary on the front page of my website. The toolkit (Nesta, Book 2, p.2) recommends beginning with two sentences: "What is it that I do?" and "Why should my customers care?". In this case, the first might be:

>I design and develop interactive experiences.  

It's a bit dry and factual. 

>I use code to design and make interactive experiences.

That's a bit better — it references both design and technology.

>I'm a creative coder working where people, design and technology meet.

Although the phrase "creative coder" does have a slightly pejorative overtone, as mentioned earlier, it does summarise a lot of key concepts. It hits more of the "sticky" beats, too: there's an emotional element to "creative", "coder" is more concrete, and phrasing it as "people, design, and technology" is a simpler concept than "interaction design", for example.

Answering the second question — "Why should my customers care?" — means I have get a bit more specific about the actual services I'm offering. Again, it needs to hit as much of the SUCCES checklist as possible, although this isn't necessary something that would be presented to potential clients — it's values to guide that process, though. The bottom line is I can make something that works for your users' needs that you don't have the skills to conceptualise or build. Phrased in a slightly less blunt fashion: 

>I can make digital products and services to enhance you and your users' experiences.

Now that we have a core framework for the business' values, how do we put that into practice?



####What are the requirements?
The principal expression of a brand identity for a business with a digital focus is almost inevitably going to be a website. An online portfolio is a space that can be dedicated to telling a single story, or set of linked stories, which show off skills, abilities, and achievements. While it's important to be discoverable online, , there are whole businesses built around search engine optimisation — the practice of adjusting a website's content to make it appear as high as possible in search engine results (principally Google, which remains by far the most popular)(Lee, 2012). While there are general good practices that all sites can and should follow, given the importance of referrals and personal contacts that has been repeatedly shown, [hasn't it?] and the relatively niche, non-geographic nature of the creative technology industry, large amounts of traffic from search engines is  less important than cultivating good quality personal contacts. 

The corollary of that is the necessity of having something for those contacts to remember you by, especially since the name the business operates under is not the easiest to recollect or spell. The humble business card is the obvious physical solution to this problem, and also poses a useful design problem to apply to the rest of the brand identity: what are the most essential pieces of information which have to be conveyed? What can be distilled down or removed entirely? The constraints of the format necessitate a thoughtful approach which can be usefully applied in other contexts. 



####Brand Guidelines
The standard method for ensuring this united brand identity is to have a set of brand guidelines. This provides a standardised approach to the visual and editorial content that represents the brand. The precise content varies depending on the brand, but can be summarised thusly (Davis, 2005, pp.206-7):

- Treatment of the logo, for example size, positioning, how it can work in different media, or with different colour schemes.
- What is the colour palette? A standard selection of foreground, background and highlight colours to use in different circumstances should be provided.
- Typefaces, for logos, headings and body copy. This may have to include different fonts for different media, e.g. what works on screen may not work so well in print.
- "Look and Feel" covers the general style and approach, including laying elements out, textures, and most other graphic design concepts.   
- Photography: When can it be used? Is there a thematic link with the subjects? 
- Tone of voice: how does the brand come across in writing and in speech? Friendly or formal? This should apply to all copy that represents the brand, no matter how insignificant it may seem. 

Not all brands necessarily have such detailed guidelines covering all these points, but some general guidance helps maintain a unified front. My brand identity is not incredibly complex, and it only has to work in a few situations, but in the past they've been approached on an ad-hoc basis. Some common-sense principles and a few specific settings for colour and typography should serve to provide the consistency across screen and print that is needed. We'll tackle them in a slightly different order.

####Typography
Using a classic serif header/sans-serif combination, Linux Biolinum G will serve as a heading font, with Linux Libertine G for body copy. Fortunately, both are available for free use, and provide an excellent balance of restrained modern styling and excellent readability at small sizes. This approach shows a tasteful approach to design, without the overtly technological slant the previously used font, Jura, had. 

####Colour
Following a maxim of not using pure black or pure white (Gifford, 2011, c.1:08:30) the main colours are xxx and xxx. These can be used in different combinations depending on the requirements. In print, the darker colour can be used on plain paper if needed. 

xxx and xxx provide secondary colours, for use in accents, rollovers. They should not be used as the main colour in a composition.  

####Logo Concepts
A logo is probably the most common association people make with a brand. It is not, however, the most important thing, nor does it necessarily require deep conceptual meaning. 

>Should a logo be self explanatory? It is only by association with a product, a service, a business or a corporation that a logo takes on any real meaning. It derives its meaning and usefulness from the quality of that which it symbolizes. (Rand, 1993, p.58).

He cites Mercedes Benz as an example of a logo whose power is derived not from any literal connection but "is a great symbol, not because its design is great but because it stands for a great product" (ibid, p.61). On this basis, something functional will suffice for our purposes. 

Constraints are often beneficial for designers. In this case, the logo has been designed to be visible and identifiable at small sizes; specifically,  the sixteen pixel square of the favicon of a standard web browser tab. This provides a simple focal point that is appropriate in both online and print contexts, links with the overall typographic style of the brand, and which is simple and flexible enough to work with almost any combination of colours. 

####Look and feel 
The overall style should be crisp, clean and modern, with a strict grid for layout. Texture should be minimal, and shouldn't try to emulate physical materials unnecessarily. Affordances must be made for usability and accessibility, especially onscreen. For example, links should be obvious without requiring to be hovered over. 

####Tone of voice
This should be similar to my personal tone of voice — fairly informal and friendly, while remaining generally rational and balanced. Choose an appropriate time and place to be more emotive, when needed — showing passion is better than remaining impartial all the time — but above all, avoid "legalese", unnecessary jargon or the stilted prose of a buzzword heavy CV. Complex details are fine (and often necessary, when dealing with technical work) but they should still be as readable and enjoyable as possible. 

####Photography
This isn't really important at this point, since any imagery is more likely to be depicting a project I worked on, rather than selected for purely aesthetic value. I'm going to leave this one open for now.  

####Implementation

- Business card
- CV
- homepage
- blog homepage
- logo development
- colour swatches and logo colours

###Networking
Regardless of how well thought out and designed a personal brand is, it's far less effective than talking to other people in the creative community. Clare Brennan, Rory Gianni and Malath Abbas all made much the same point in conversation: being present and visible, whether as a practitioner, a facilitator, or both, is vital to establishing a creative freelance business. Wherever the business ends up being based (which, at the time of writing, is by no means certain), attending local networking eventss is essential. There are Tech Meetups in cities across Scotland  and beyond, as well as a host of other more specialised meetings. On a wider scale, being seen as an active participant in creative communities, be that on Twitter, through the code sharing platform Github, on forums dedicated to particular tools, or elsewhere are a necessary activity to maintain a network of people who might be able to throw you work in the future. 

_______

##Conclusion

While branding, marketing and networking are, to many creative freelancers, distractions from their primary interest of making things, as we've seen, they are vital considerations which have to be considered constantly over the life cycle of a freelance practice. 

It's not all bad though: brands are, at heart, collections of stories. A personal brand is a personal story; as humans, we tell stories all the time. Having a coherent narrative that can adapt to different circumstances comes naturally to us; with a little thought and attention to some best practices, like the SUCCES checklist we looked at earlier, we have something that will stay with people.

We mustn't forget that that is the ultimate goal here: to have our work, and our stories, stay with people. Cultivating an image and a brand through our stories affects how we are perceived. Simple techniques, like keeping a consistent and thought through visual style and tone of voice, reinforces it. That perception is one of the most important factors in getting work, even for people who would rather let their work speak for them. 

The work can only tell part of the story. The worker has to be responsible for the rest. I hope this report has provided a blueprint for doing so.
