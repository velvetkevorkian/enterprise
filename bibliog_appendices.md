##Appendices

###Appendix A: Lambie-Nairn/Telefonica internship
Excuse the personal tone of this section, but it seems appropriate as a piece of reflective writing rather than an academic summary. 

I spent the majority of summer 2013 (mid May to mid August) working in London. The client commissioning the project, Telefónica UK, have a number of initiatives aimed at giving young (and in my case, not *so* young) people opportunities in training and work, which come under their commitments to being a sustainable business. As part of this, they commissioned Lambie-Nairn to find two paid interns to design and build Telefónica UK's sustainability report for the year. I was fortunate to be chosen to do the front end development, in partnership with a graphic designer. We worked closely with the client and both the design team at Lambie-Nairn and their digital partners at Morph London. As a result, I got to see how a larger branding agency works, as well as a smaller more specialist digital agency. This has also given me the opportunity to do some freelance development work with the digital agency. From this I can draw a few conclusions: 
- As noted repeatedly, personal contacts are vital. 
- In terms of income, freelancing as a front-end developer would be a viable route for me to take, even if not as a primary goal. 
- Working for a smaller specialist agency is far more appealing to me than being part of a large team.
- The ability to get things done and get them out the door is more important than worrying about the technical minutiae of a particular solution.
- "Soft" skills are even more important. Being able to communicate and work with both clients and other team members is probably the key factor in almost every situation. 

There are also a number of logistical and organisational lessons I learned, from both experience and observation. Unfortunately these are harder to distil into an easily told story, being both dependent on having the context explained, and possibly slightly unflattering to some of those concerned. The stories told publicly about this (great!) experience will have to be selected to reflect that. 

I was surprised to find how much weight some people place on LinkedIn as a recruitment tool. The MD of the digital agency I was working with received several hundred applications last time they advertised a full-time position, and he used LinkedIn references to whittle that down to a shortlist of a dozen or so to interview. It just reinforces how important making contacts and getting personal references is, for freelancers and full-timers alike. 

###Appendix X: Portfolio Website Proposal

####Overview
As part of the branding process, an updated website is required, reflecting the brand identity. This document sets out the reasoning behind the design, development, and content strategy.

####Technical/Design Requirements
The design and implementation of a website should be considered holistically, rather than creating artificial distinctions between disciplines. 

- The site needs to show a selection of work in a portfolio style. The main page should show summaries of all featured projects with links to more in-depth material on separate pages. 
- The site should follow the style guide previously laid out for visual design.
- The site must be fast and easy to use. It should be responsive and touch friendly, so as to work well on all devices regardless of screen size and form factor. 
- It should implement Twitter cards, Open Graph (Facebook/LinkedIn), and Google+ authorship metadata, to ensure all presences are connected and search engine optimised as per best practices. 
- Ideally it would implement a technique for responsive images, although since there is not yet a standards-based solution it's difficult to choose a solution that doesn't complicate matters more than it helps. 
- The design/development should extend across both the main site and the blog, keeping as much continuity as possible in the branding, user experience and implementation as possible.
