#Rory Gianni interview notes
##04/11/2013: 13:00

- Trained as web developer (applied computing)
- Says it's easy to get boxed in to one discipline. 
- Interested in tech entrepeneurship->diverted into sustainability entrepreneurship
- Was interested in taking tech ideas into the real world- making them concrete
- As a freelance developer, the job is never *just* development (elements of design, user experience etc). Consulting for startups means taking their whole idea into consideration. 
- CleanWeb is not just "Green IT" (i.e. engineering solutions) but using technology together with social solutions to come sustainable solutions
- Research project in Tiree investigating the connection people have with energy sources, and creating artefacts to help show those relationships. 
- (Specialisation or diversification?)
- Perception of other people and their work can be more important than reality. Teaching, speaking, being seen as an organiser/facilitator all affect people's perception. (Reinforces that this is fundamentally a marketing problem)
- Cleanweb - answers aren't necessarily technological. Elements of service design/ethnography etc - overlaps between disciplines. 
- Distinction between the industry/sector you're operating in and the role you're playing within that sector. In this case, Rory's role is becoming broader (more than just tech, including service design etc), while focusing on a specific sector (sustainability).
- "cannibal hats"- spreading resources too thin. 
- Could focusing on sustainability side be damaging to non-sustainability related opportunities? Would the increase in sustainability work compensate?
