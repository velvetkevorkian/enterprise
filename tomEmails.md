Hi Tom,
Hope all is well down in the big smoke.
I was hoping to ask a small favour of you. As part of my course I need to
look at my personal branding and professional presentation. I'm trying to
benchmark how effective my current profile is. Since you were my point of
contact for recruitment, if you have time it would be great to get your
thoughts on how I presented myself when I first applied for the
internship.

It'd be nice to get an idea of whether there was a particular factor that
stood out (e.g. designy CV, portfolio, demonstrable experience, etc), how
much of it was down to the test project and whether there was anything
that you think could stand to be improved.

I'd ask Mr Fairweather too but as far as I know he's on a boat eating
seagulls or something now.

Let me know if you have any questions. It would be great to get some more
professional perspective.

Thanks
Kyle

ps say hi to the rest of the L-N crew for me!

Hi Kyle

Good to hear from you. Be glad to help although I'm off this week but will
endeavour to get something sent through soon, don't hesitate to send me a
reminder though! Although David has actually  left LN now I'll try to get
him to feedback as well.

Speak soon
Tom

Hi Kyle

Here's an assessment from myself and Dave. I've written in a reference style in case you need to forward on at any stage and I've literally copied what Dave had to say, where he talks in more detail about your folio/website and how in his opinion it could be improved. Over all there are very few negatives from us which was testament to how you applied yourself to your time with us. Let me know if the below is suffice…

FROM ME:

We didn't get to meet Kyle face-to-face for the interview but he verbally presented himself well on the calls and came across quietly assured and confident. The task set was delivered in a thorough manner, on time and although there were expected technical difficulties (given Kyle's experience), he was honest and up front with his assessment of his results. He wasn't afraid to highlight elements that proved difficult to execute and didn't bluff his way through. 

Without Anthony's feedback it's hard for me to give detailed opinion on the technical delivery of the test however I do know that Anthony said that for Kyle's level of experience it was a good effort. In addition to the test, Anthony was very impressed by Kyle's attitude and work ethic. In fact he said that it's exactly what he looks for in his full time staff – head down, hard working and without fuss.

Personally, what impressed me was how Kyle wasn't afraid to ask questions or give a considered opinion throughout all stages of the project. Whether you have the confidence to do this or not, asking questions is so important (no matter how basic they might seem). I hope Kyle enjoyed his time with us and hopefully it has given him a priveledged insight to how all sides work (client, agency, production).

FROM DAVID:

Personal branding's tricky. And somewhat subjective. Some people/studios love a high-impact over-the-top approach such as http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/ I personally prefer a much simpler/pared back style e.g not much of a personal brand, simple website or pdf showing your best work, up-to-date LinkedIn etc.

I like Kyle's no-nonsense personality, honesty and wit. I think it's important that side of him is visible in his profile and I think it'll help him stand out.

For employability I'd suggest he's a bit more prescriptive about his skill set. On his website he talks about 'Making design/web/code/art/sound things.' and 'Finely Crafted Electrons'. It's not really clear that he could knock you up an awesome website. I think he should show some of his work on the homepage too.

He might want to look at re-ordering the projects in his portfolio/website as well, depending on the direction he wants to take. If he's looking for more experimental /advanced tech positions keep those first or more commercial web development maybe re-shuffle those to the top etc.

I can't comment on whether the test project clinched it for Kyle or not, but I seem to remember Anthony being suitably impressed.
